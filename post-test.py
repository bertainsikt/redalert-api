Sofiane.mp3   http://t.co/E9XnFYOw","ANIC is a Tāghūtī organisation founded upon KUFR!! Many are unaware of the reality of ANIC (Australian National Imams Council)  which is run by its president  Suleiman Shady (who permits joining the army  police force and making tahākum). It s an organisation which has abolished the principle of Walā  and Barā   taken democracy as its way of life  whilst engaging in interfaith and much more which will be covered in this brief post Inshā Allāh. Tom Zreika is also the co founder of ANIC who s a kāfir mushrik lawyer  and he wrote an article back in 2006 speaking about the recommendations which the organisation of ANIC strictly upholds. I provided a link to the document in the footnotes which was released just before the formation of the Australian National Imams Council (ANIC) in 2006 entitled  Australian Imams: The Way Forward.  [1].For context  this document was released when the government s discredited  Muslim Reference Group  was discontinued and Sheikh Taj was being ousted as Mufti.Among the clear nullifiers this co founder of ANIC has founded the organisation upon include;Nullifier #1 — “To the fullest extent uphold and promote the rule of law”. ANIC is not just upholding man made Tāghūtī laws  but promoting them and calling upon the muslim community to adhere to these laws and even make tahākum to it..!!Nullifier #2 — “Not in any way  shape or form derogate from the full compliance of the laws of Australia”. Allāhul Musta ān  they have founded ANIC based upon pure compliance with Australian man made laws  without even derogating a single aspect of the law  this is clear major shirk of obedience!Allāh سُحانه وتعالى said those who obey the mushrikīn in permitting the ميتة  you would be mushrikīn  so imagine someone who obeys a complete man made Kufr constitution?!Nullifier #3 — “Not justify the breaking of the laws of Australia”. This implies that if a law prohibited something that s halāl or even wājib in the sharī ah  then ANIC says it will never justify breaking it subhān Allāh! This negates major fundamentals of Walā  and Barā  which we ll come too Inshā Allāh.Nullifier #4 — “Re affirm its allegiance to the Nation of Australia  its symbols and insignia”. Allāhu akbar!! Can you imagine someone giving allegiance to the Nation of Quraysh  Abū Jahl  Abū Lahab and the mushrikīn?! This purely falls under the nullifier of giving loyalty  allegiance and support to the kuffār.Nullifier #5 — “Become a member of an emergency organisation (and promote same) in their locality such as the Bush Fire Service  Surf Life Saving  or any other emergency service provider”. One of the agreements ANIC made with the kuffār is to become members of an emergency organisation and promote it  and this is exactly what the head of ANIC did  the Tāghūt Suleiman Shady (may Allāh curse him)  along with the Muftī  giving fatwās that you can join the army and police force!Nullifier #6 — “Do all things necessary to prevent any radicalisation orthe breeding of fanatical opinions”. Lā hawlā walā quwatā ilā billāh  it s as if we see this right infront of our eyes! Look at how they are being funded by the Tawāghīt to spy upon the muslims  setting up de radicalisation “shuyūkh” in numerous places  to prevent the muslims from believing in what s obligatory within their Dīn of Tawhīd and what it entails of takfīr upon the mushrikīn  while being taught to uphold the laws of Kufr  which is an absolute negator of Walā  and Barā .Nullifier #7 — “Conduct themselves in a manner consistent with Australian values”. Now this is explained by what they previously mentioned of upholding and promoting the Kufr man made law  and ANIC frequently repeats these words in their announcements and letters  wallāhul musta ān.Moreover  those who join this disbelieving organisation are not exempted from blame whatsoever  no matter what excuse they use  such as the most common preventing other sects from banning books and other weak claims  as maslaha for da wah does not permit committing Kufr whatsoever.The noble Imām  Shaykh Sulaymān Ibn Nāsir al  Alwān (فك الله أسره) says:“The Haneef is the one who turns away from Shirk. The Muwahhid Haneef  is he who is determined to worship Allāh and avoids polytheism in all of its different types  forms  shades and colours.He avoids the shirk of the past and present  from worshipping Ahwā  (desires)  Asnām (statues)  Awthān (idols)  and making du ā to other than Allah.He also has to avoid implementing the ruling of the Tāghūt  and making Tahākum to it (i.e. seeking judgement from the Tāghūt)  or joining the disbelieving organizations and what s similar to that.”Concerning the famous Āyah on those who mocked the reciters of the Qur ān  Shaykh al ‘Allāmah ‘Abdul ‘Azīz at Tuwayla ī (تقبله الله) provides outstanding benefits in his amazing commentary upon “Nawāqidh al Islām” (Nullifier #6)  he writes:“And another benefit it contains is that the one who participates in Kufr and being pleased with it  and sitting with the one who says such words in a fashion that accompanies approving of it  (then) ALL of them are Kuffār  for indeed in the verse Allāh has judged the Kufr of every individual within that group of people who sat by & did not give an exception or excuse to any of them  despite the fact that the one speaking is only 1 person and the rest are simply listeners  and as for  the group that Allāh has pardoned   then it has been said it was a man who rebuked some of their speech  and it has been said  what is meant is that a group among them repented  and Allāh pardoned them  and the other group remained upon its Kufr and Hypocrisy  so that is the one which is punished (as stated in the Āyah).”So while the Imāms of Kufr are passing out fatwā on behalf of every single one of your registered names  don t think you will be excused from Kufr for remaining silent  rather it s necessary that you make barā ah from this KUFR organisation in totality!Therefore  I call upon all the members of ANIC to make tawbah to Allāh and publicly make barā ah from this Tāghūt organisation which has harmed muslims in favour of the kuffār!#ANIC | #KUFR | #TĀGHŪT | #MURJIAH","What is the real meaning of Secularism ? What is its definition and purpose ? Are the people who call for or support Secularism in the elections still Muslim ? The definition of Secularism according to the Merriam Webster Dictionary is :   indifference to or rejection or exclusion of religion and religious considerations  To put it simply  a person who calls for Secularism rejects and disbelieves in Allah (SWT)  he is an Atheist when it comes to Politics. Secularism is Atheism in Politics. The ones who adhere and follow this ideology are Murtadeen to the highest order. As Allah (SWT) says in the glorious Qur an : And whosoever does not judge by what Allâh has revealed  such are the Kâfirûn  So the one who judges by man made laws is a Mushrik and a disbeliever  Allah (SWT) says:“Legislation is not but for Allah.” Ibn Kathir (RA) says in Al Bidayyah wa l Nihayyah Book 13  about the Mongols who claimed to be Muslim but still ruled with Al Yaasiq [the laws of the Tartars]:“ Whoever does that  he has disbelieved by the Ijmaa of the Muslims.” [al Bidayyah Wa l Nihayyah  13/118 119] Nobody has the right to Legislate besides Allah (SWT)  and to disbelieve in Allah (SWT)s laws in the matters of state governance and politics is Kufr Al Akbar","We do not eat the meat of the animal Slaughtered by a Rafidhi   Because he is an Apostate and Whoever doubts their kufr is himself a Kafir......[Sharh usul itiqaad Ahl ul sunnah 8/459] So Mr chacolate Yaseen Malik falls among them[Apotates] and rest jamaats too whom r supporting these kufrs wa murtadeens.","The Ijma a of the scholars upon a Disbelieving Ruler  Ruling Muslim. !!!The scholars all agree that the Imaamah (  rule ) of a disbeliever is not sound from outset. A disbeliever is not to have the reins of control over the affairs of the Muslims. Ibn al Mundhir (r.a) stated   Everyone I have memorized from of the people of knowledge agrees that a disbeliever is not to have authority over a Muslim under any circumstances.Takhrij : Ibn al Mundhir.Ibn Qayyim also stated the same in his book called.Now to the statement !! I came across one Talib ilm back two years ago. During the campaign and election of the country of Ghana. Said to me in a vocal statement. Oh we the Muslim need to vote in the Democratic elections to get rid off the kuffar government and elect a Muslim government. So I ask why he has that ideological  his statement was so that we can have a Muslim ruler. So my questions was which Hukum will be presented in the country? His answer was  it will take time to implement Shari ah because is Kuffar land. Automatically he has answer his own question which I m about to ask him.You want to used Kufr Akbar to eradicate kufr Akbar in Darul Kufr to establish Shari ah. Like Muhammed Mursi did ? Lol lol now where is he Now? In Fatah Sisi Prison  is Kufr and Shirk to vote for a kaafir to become your leader as a Muslim. Allah (swt) said in a Muhkamatu ayat يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ وَأُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْكُمْ ۖ فَإِنْ تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَحْسَنُ تَأْوِيلًا O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad SAW)  and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves  refer it to Allah and His Messenger (SAW)  if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.

A soldier s job is to kill the enemy or get killed    he says. Murtadeen are more proud of their deaths for kufr than some Muslims are of their Shuhadah for Islam.","When you engage in kufr and human waste  the outcome is mainly two: 1. The rise or rather the more free environment for atheists and secularists. This includes: More freedom to publicly insult Allah and His Messengers and to bring out the alternative Islamic narrative that Pentagon is pushing for in a public and open way. Will attack and oppress Muslims who do not support Democratic systems and will mock Sunnah and it s people on a daily basis. Freedom will be limitless  so insults to Allah and His Messengers and His Deen becomes a fundamental human right. 2. The rise of misguidance like Sufism. This also includes other modern misguidance as well as the alternative narrative a bit toned down and hidden or subtle way. Somewhat against insults at least theoretically. Both outcomes will NOT stop nudity  fornication  interest  music and other vulgarities in fact it will increase and rules will help it grow under various names like youth  women  culture  art  etc..
